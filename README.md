# Hi!
I am a physicist, and I sometimes contribute to OSS.

My main projects now are:
- **ForSys**: A tool to infer stresses from microscopy images and videos in live tissues [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/borgesaugusto/forsys)](https://github.com/borgesaugusto/forsys)
- **seapipy**: An API to generate Surface Evolver files to aid in simulating biological tissues [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/borgesaugusto/seapipy)](https://github.com/borgesaugusto/seapipy)
- **shapers**: A library to perform operations in different 2D shapes [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/borgesaugusto/shapers)](https://github.com/borgesaugusto/shapers)
